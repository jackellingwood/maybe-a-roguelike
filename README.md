# maybe-a-roguelike
It could be...

I have used the tcod python library (as well as a helpful [tutorial](https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/)) to create a modern-warfare-style roguelike dungeon crawler, Hostile Corridors.

I've added:

* Ranged weaponry
* Ammo boxes
* Ammo and melee Durability mechanics
* Accuracy mechanic
* Style changes (color, item names)
* Wandering Enemies
* Added some “god mode” statements for debugging
* Balanced (mostly)
* Added sound design
* Made a game [manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YbWhaKaejrf7nLcxSUN2LKQPBspQJZrdnCPpPTuC1aY/edit)
